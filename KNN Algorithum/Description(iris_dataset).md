# k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classification with Iris Dataset
This  demonstrates the use of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm for classifying the Iris dataset. 
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset used in machine learning to classify iris flowers into three species based on four features. 
This implementation uses the sklearn library to split the data, train a k-NN classifier, and evaluate its performance.

##  Installation
To run this code, you'll need Python installed along with the following libraries:
-numpy
-pandas
-scikit-learn
-matplotlib
-seaborn
You can install these libraries using pip:
# pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
# Load the Dataset: 
The code loads the Iris dataset from a CSV file.

#Preprocess Data: 
It separates the features (input variables) and the target (output variable), then splits the data into training and testing sets.
# Train k-NN Classifier: 
The k-NN classifier is initialized with 
k=3 and trained on the training set.
# Predict and Evaluate
The classifier predicts the species of the test set and evaluates its performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Separating Features and Target:

Features (input variables) and target (output variable) are extracted. The data is then split into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split.
Training the k-NN Classifier:

A k-NN classifier is created with
k=3. The classifier is trained using the training data.
# Making Predictions:
Predictions are made on the test set. The performance of the classifier is evaluated using accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report.
Evaluation Metrics:
# Accuracy
The ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations.
$ Confusion Matrix 
A matrix showing the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
# Classification Report
A detailed report showing precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
## Notes
Ensure the Iris dataset CSV file is located at /content/Iris.csv or update the path accordingly.
Adjust the n_neighbors parameter in KNeighborsClassifier as needed for different results.
