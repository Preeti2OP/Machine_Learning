## Introduction
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from and make decisions based on data. image

## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning algorithms are used to predict outcomes based on labeled input data. Here are some common supervised learning algorithms included in this repository:

-Linear Regression A method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation.

-Logistic Regression A classification algorithm used to model the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.

-Decision Trees A decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequenc-es.

-Random Forest An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

-K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies data based on the closest training examples in the feature space.

-Support Vector Machines (SVM) A classification method that finds the hyperplane which best separates the data into different classes.

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning algorithms are used to identify patterns and structure in unlabeled data. Here are some common unsupervised learning algorithms included in this repository:

-K-Means Clustering A clustering algorithm that partitions data into k clusters based on feature similarity.
-Principal Component Analysis (PCA) A dimensionality-reduction technique that transforms data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining most of the variance.
-Hierarchical Clustering A clustering method that builds a hierarchy of clusters using either agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down) approaches.
-t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) A technique for dimensionality reduction that visualizes high-dimensional data by mapping it to a lower-dimensional space.
